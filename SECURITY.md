# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to addressing security issues in the **latest release** of the Checkbox Sync plugin available in the Obsidian Community Plugins store.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately through **GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature**. You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and will work with you to understand and address the issue. We appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing your findings.
